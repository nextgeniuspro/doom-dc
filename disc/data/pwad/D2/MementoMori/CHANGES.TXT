This is the updated version of Memento Mori. Here is a list of all
the changes:

- Maps changed due to bug-fixes or due to gameplay-improvements:
  Map 2, 5, 7, 16, 21, 28 and 32. 
- Fixed Demo-bug. 
- Fixed name-bug of map 21.
- Fixed order of map-titles.
- Several changes of the Info-pack.

This is the last version of Memento Mori (hopefully). If you are going
to play Multiplayer games with MM, be sure to have the same version on
every system! There is no upgrade-system available, just overwrite the
old Memento Mori WAD files.
