 Please note: most levels of Memento Mori were built with Co-Op play
              in mind. All levels are playable in Single-Player Mode
              as well,  but sometimes it  might seem a  bit strange,
              that's because of disabled Multi-Player-Features.

              Playing Memento Mori in Co-Op will be much more fun!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Please get the file MMINFO.ZIP, it contains ALL you want to know about
 Memento Mori, the authors etc. It has screenshots, music and information
 about every single level. GET IT NOW!

  Q1) What do I need to play Memento Mori?
  A1) First you'll need the original version of Doom II installed on
      your hard-disc. Version1.9 is best. If you do not own Doom II,
      go buy it. Second you'll need  ALL THREE ZIP files  containing
      Memento Mori, they are called MM1_3.ZIP, MM2_3.ZIP & MM3_3.ZIP
      Additionally you can download the MM-Info-Pack, which contains
      background information, screenshots and info on how to contact
      the authors of Memento Mori.

  Q2) I've unpacked the ZIP file and there is no install-program.
      What now?
  A2) Get ALL THREE ZIP files, unpack them (in a temporary directory)
      and start INSTALL.EXE.

  Q3) Okay, the install-program worked fine, how do I start MM now?
  A3) Change into your Doom II directory and start MM.EXE.
      This program lets you choose wether or not you like to disable
      the Cheat-Codes and new music. After pressing F10, MM.EXE will
      call id's DeathManager.  Now choose your favourite game-type &
      skill and start playing.
      DO NOT change anything on the external WAD settings!
      If you like to play alone or you like to watch the Demos,  run
      STARTMM.BAT

  Q4) The MM.EXE doesn't seem to work.  How can I play Memento Mori
      without this program?
  A4) Either run  id's DeathManager, enter  both WAD-files (MM.WAD &
      MMMUS.WAD) and ENABLE external WADs or use the command line to
      start Doom II: doom2 -file mm.wad mmmus.wad [...]

  Q5) After having played Memento Mori for a while,  everytime I run
      Doom II the Cheat-Codes don't work anymore! Help!
  A5) Try this:
      del doom2.exe
      ren doom2.mm doom2.exe

  Q6) Everytime I run  MM with the command-line,  Doom II breaks and
      does not even let me into the main menu. What's that?
  A6) That's probably because you don't have version 1.9 of Doom II.
      Update your game or try starting Doom II with either MM.EXE or
      id's DeathManager (see Q3/Q4).

  Q7) The MM-Info-Pack doesn't seem to run, it always hangs.
  A7) Try starting it with the '-nosound' parameter.

  Q8) The MM-Info-Pack is very very dark, how do I fix this?
  A8) Try hitting the 'G' or 'F11' key, to enable gamma-correction.
      Also, try re-ajusting the brightness of your monitor.

  Q9) Where can I send my 'congratulations and thanks' to? How can I
      support Memento Mori?
  A9) a) check our WebPage and use our offers, like Voting etc.
      b) let everyone know how cool MM is, post to newsgroups etc.
      c) if you have your own WebPage, make a link to ours! :)
